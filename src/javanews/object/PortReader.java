/**
 * Used to receive data from a named COM port. The application allows for any
 * named port to be accessed providing it is recognised as a Serial port by the
 * underlying RxTx libraries. Multiple instances of this class can be used to
 * access multiple COM ports with each class instance accessing a uniquely
 * named port.
 * <p>Each port must be freely accessible for the application to work
 * correctly with it and so there cannot any other application attempting to
 * access the same port as JavaNews. The COM port configuration window can be
 * used to identify whether a port is in use by another application. This window
 * should also be used to set the configuration values for each port as it
 * contains the supported values for each setting.
 * <p>The application expects COM port configuration values to be one of those
 * listed below. JavaNews uses restricted values for user entry (in the COM port
 * configuration window) and verification of values here to ensure that no
 * invalid values can be configured with a port and thus cause system instability
 * either for the application or for the platform on which it is operating.
 * <p><h2>Supported Argument Values:</h2>
 * The following lists show supported values for each of the arguments required
 * when configuring a COM port. While the constructor will accept any values
 * compatible with the given data type, only certain values are supported by the
 * RxTx configuration and the COM port itself. These, accepted, values are
 * listed below and should any value not be supported those shown as default
 * values will be used instead.
 * <h3>Baud Rate (bps)</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>110</li>
 *   <li>300</li>
 *   <li>600</li>
 *   <li>1200</li>
