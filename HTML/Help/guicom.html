<p>JavaNews uses a separate window for each COM port that is being monitored. This is shown below, you can click on the image to enlarge it. 
There are various items of use contained within the screen and this page 
outlines all of them.</p>

<p>The COM port window (Click to enlarge)</p>
</div>
	<h4>The Title-Bar</h4>
	<p>The title-bar of the window (the text along the top of the window) shows 
	the name of the COM port the window is monitoring and the settings used to 
	connect to the port. This is in the format: baud rate - data bits - parity 
	type - stop bits. Please note that the parity type is shown as the first letter of the type being used.</p>
	<h4>The Menu-Bar</h4>
	<p>The menu contains two items, File and View. Each of these have further 
	option beneath them.</p>
	<p>The File option allows for the current window to be closed and exited 
	from. There is also an option to save the contents of the messages as 
	displayed in the central section of the window to a Comma Separated Value 
	(CSV) file. CSV files can be opened in many spreadsheet programs and are 
	stored in plain text. If you select this option you will be prompted for a 
	filename and location of where to store the new file.</p>
	<p>The View option contains three options. The first to view the raw data 
	received from the COM port prior to processing. This produces a new window 
	to display the data and is covered in more detail <a href="guiraw.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The other two options on the View menu allow for charts to be displayed 
	showing statistics relating to the number and percentages of links in each 
	of the three states. More information about these windows can be seen <a href="guichart.html">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>The Main Window</h3>
	<p>The main part of the window is split into three vertical columns each 
	with a different purpose. The left-hand column allows for reports to be 
	generated. The central column shows messages received from the COM port. The 
	right-hand column lists links and their status. This column is split into 
	two to show those links and PSEs which have already been recognised and 
	inputted into the database, shown at the top, and those new links which have 
	been discovered while the application has been running.</p>
	<h4>Reports</h4>
	<p>The left-hand column shows reports that can be run within the database. 
	There are two types of these, those by date or those on a particular link or 
	PSE node. The lists of reports can be expanded like a directory in a file 
	explorer, by clicking on the folders. The data reports will allow you to see 
	all messages received within a certain timeframe from the moment you click 
	on the report you require.</p>
	<p>PSE and link reports can be run by finding the node you require from the 
	alphabetical list and either clicking on the folder to run a report showing 
	all messages received from all links configured on that node over all dates. 
	Links are listed under their respective PSE node and will filter the results 
	to those messages from that link on that PSE over all dates.</p>
	<p>Report windows allow for the entries to be sorted, by clicking on the 
	column headers, or exported by clicking on the Export Data item on the menu 
	and then Save As CSV. This will save the displayed data in a Comma Separated 
	Value format which can be accessed by many spreadsheet programs.</p>
	<h4>Messages</h4>
	<p>The messages column within the window shows a table containing all of the 
	received messages since the application was launched. It does not show those 
	messages in the database (these can be retrieved through the reports). The 
	messages column can be a little cramped but the column headers can be 
	adjusted to widen a column of importance or sort the entries within the 
	table by clicking on it (clicking again will reverse sort the entries in the 
	table by that column).</p>
	<p>All of the information from a message can be seen by double-clicking on 
	the message. This will give you the message window, more actions can be 
	performed within this window which are covered <a href="guicomdata.html">here</a>.</p>
	<h4>Links</h4>
	<p>Both links which are stored within the database, that is recognised by 
	the program, and newly discovered are shown on the right-hand side of the 
	screen. This is intended to be an at-a-glance view of the state of the 
	network that is being monitored. When the application is first launched all 
	links are set to an unknown state. The program makes no assumptions on the 
	state of a link unless it explicitly received a LINK UP or LINK DOWN 
	message. At this point the link is changed to an up or down state. This is 
	shown by a change of colour from GREY (unknown) to GREEN (link up) to RED 
	(link down). The state column can be sorted to show those links as down at 
	the top of the list. The list is updated dynamically so those which do 
	change to down in a sorted list will jump to the top.</p>
	<p>Links and PSEs that generate messages received on the COM port that have 
	not previously been entered into the database will be shown in the bottom 
	section of new or unrecognised links. Changes to the status of these links 
	are also monitored.</p>
	<p>You can also double-click on any link entry to view more information on that link and 
	edit its entry in the database, add new links and acknowledge newly 
	discovered links. More information on this can be found <a href="guirecord.html">here</a>.</p>
