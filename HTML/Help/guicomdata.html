<p>In the window for each COM port being monitored you will find that information is summarised within three
tables. These tables are split across the screen in the center and right-hand sides:</p>
<h4>Received messages (center)</h4>
<p>This contains a summary of information about the messages received on a COM port. This summary includes (from left to right):</p>
<ul>
	<li>The severity of the message</li>
	<li>The name of the PSE that generated the message</li>
	<li>The identifier of the link on the named PSE that generated the message</li>
	<li>The message contents that have been received</li>
	<li>The date, according to the PSE, when the message was sent</li>
	<li>The unique identifier of the message within the application</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recognised links (top-right)</h4>
<p>This contains the name of the PSE and link ID for each of the recognised links along with its current status displayed as a colour:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Grey</strong> - Link state unknown: A message has not been 
	received that explicitly mentions the links state. PSE nodes themselves will 
	stay in this state.</li>
	<li><strong>Red</strong> - Link down: A message has been received that 
	specifically mentions this link as being down (LINK DOWN).</li>
	<li><strong>Green</strong> - Link up: A LINK UP message has been received 
	explicitly stating that the link is up and ready.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Discovered links (bottom-right)</h4>
<p>This displays the same information as for recognised links. However a link which has sent a message to this COM port which isn't known
in the recognised links table will be entered here. You can &quot;acknowledge&quot; 
discovered links which moves them into the recognised table and allows you to 
run reports on them. For more information on how to do this, click <a href="guirecord.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Detailed information</h3>
<p>You are able to view details of the records displayed within JavaNews. You can do this by 
double-clicking on an entry that is showing a recognised link, discovered link 
or a received message. The details you can see depends on the type of entry you 
selected, whether messages or links.</p>
<h4>Recognised &amp; discovered links</h4>
<p>If you double-click on a link (listed in the two table on the right-hand side 
of the JavaNews window) which is either recognised (top) or discovered (bottom) 
then you will see more information about the link displayed in a window like 
this:</p>
	<div class="centered">
		<img alt="Detailed link information screen" height="240" src="resources/guicomdata-link.png" width="423" />
	</div>
<p>Within this screen you can see the following information about the link:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The COM port the link is configured on</li>
	<li>The PSE name the link is attached to</li>
	<li>The link ID within the PSE</li>
	<li>The details of the link</li>
	<li>A description of the link</li>
	<li>The current status of the link (link up, link down or unknown)</li>
	<li>When the status of the link last changed</li>
</ul>
<p>You are also able to add and edit links but this is covered in the editing 
records page which can be found <a href="guirecord.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Received messages</h4>
<p>The details of received messages show not only the information received from 
the PSE but also related information. This information can include comments 
about the message, the definition of the message received and when the message 
was actually received.</p>
	<div class="centered">
		<img alt="Detailed message information screen" height="503" src="resources/guicomdata-message.png" width="637" />
	</div>
<p>To see the status of the link which generated this message you can click on the 
&quot;Show Link&quot; button. This will display the link details screen shown previously.</p>
<p>Should you wish to add a comment to the message you can click on the &quot;Add 
Comment&quot; button. Doing this will display an input box where you can enter a 
brief comment. The comment can be up-to 255 characters including spaces, more 
than this will lead to the comment being truncated. Once you have finished 
entering your comment, click on OK and the message will be displayed in the 
table.</p>
