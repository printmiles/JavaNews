<h3>How to identify the problem</h3>
	<p>This can take on multiple forms because there are different problems that 
	could prevent the application from working. If you are able to start the 
	application and see the JavaNews window but not able to use particular 
	features and functions as described in this help system then the problem 
	could be fixed.</p>
<h3>What causes the problem</h3>
	<p>Multiple problems can cause the application from starting correctly or 
	even at all. These can vary from changes in your Java installation to not 
	being able to find the preferences file. The fixes below list simple steps 
	to eliminate many of the possible problems that would prevent JavaNews from 
	running correctly.</p>
	<p>If you have installed JavaNews and then upgraded your version of Java 
	runtime, this can stop the application from accessing the COM ports. This is 
	caused by the libraries required by JavaNews not being copied over to the 
	new version of Java, you can see how to resolve this in the add-ons section 
	below.</p>
<h3>How to fix it</h3>
	<h4>Java installation (Automated installation)</h4>
<p>The automated installation for JavaNews should ensure that everything
is in the correct place before running the application. You may find that
subsequent updates to your version of Java may cause JavaNews to report problems or
not to function normally. You should refer to the information about installing JavaNews to
copy the required libraries needed for the application to function properly. You 
can find this information <a href="jninstall.html">here</a>.</p>
	<h4>Java installation (Manual installation)</h4>
	<p>You should ensure that Java is installed and that .jar files are 
	associated with it to be able to double-click on the JavaNews.jar file in 
	Windows Explorer (or similar). Some other applications also use the .jar 
	file extension such as Nokia&#39;s PC Suite which associates the files with 
	itself instead of Java.</p>
	<p>You can create a .bat file to run a command line to navigate to the 
	JavaNews.jar file and then call the command <code>java -jar JavaNews.jar</code> to 
	run the application correctly.</p>
	<p>If you are unable to run this command then you may need to amend your 
	class-path to support this. There are plenty of resources on the internet on 
	how to change this, search for &quot;how to set java classpath&quot;.</p>
	<h4>Add-ons (RxTx &amp; JFreeChart)</h4>
	<p>JavaNews is dependant on two add-ons to the standard Java libraries to 
	provide the functions to draw charts for link statistics and accessing the 
	COM ports. These add-ons are known as RxTx and JFreeChart and consist of 
	various files. You should have installed these files during installation. If 
	not then you should refer to the information about
	<a href="javainstall.html">Installing Java</a>.</p>
	<h4>Preference files</h4>
	<p>The <code>javanews.prefs.xml</code> file is need to launch the application with your 
	preferences such as the look and feel, the COM ports to monitor and their 
	configuration. If this file is missing from your installation directory you 
	can copy a new version from the installation CD. Your settings will revert 
	to their defaults by doing this.</p>
	<h4>Test port</h4>
	<p>To use the test port a file must be placed within your installation 
	directory called <code>OpenNewsSample.txt</code>. The name is case-sensitive and the
	contents of the file must be text in the correct format from a PSE.</p>
	<p>Due to the error handling and correction algorithms within the 
	application, any text which is not considered to be a standard PSE message 
	will be ignored and so not processed.</p>
	<p>A default file has been included in the installation CD which has 
	comments and some information that can be processed by the application. You 
	can view the full contents of the file by opening it in an application like 
	Notepad or similar.</p>
	<h4>Database</h4>
	<p>Issues with the database are covered <a href="commondb.html">here</a>.</p>
