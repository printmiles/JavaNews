<p>JavaNews was built using the Java language and, because of this, can be run on any operating system that is able to run Java
SE 1.6 or higher. This includes operating systems such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
	<li>MacOS</li>
	<li>Unix</li>
	<li>Linux</li>
	<li>Solaris</li>
</ul>
<p>While the core application is able to operate in any of the listed operating 
systems, there are some considerations that must be given when running the 
application outside of a Windows environment. These are covered in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Database Type</h3>
<p>As has already been documented, the application will be able to work with ODBC
compliant databases. The types of databases supported through ODBC on your machine will vary but drivers are available for formats including Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Oracle, Paradox, Visual Fox Pro and others. </p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The add-on libraries needed for JavaNews that have been included on the 
installation CD are for the Windows platform. You may need to download 
alternative libraries for other platforms which can be found on their respective 
websites. See the <a href="bibliography.html">bibliography</a> to find the 
websites of the authors.</p>
<h3>Help System</h3>
<p>When opening the help windows within the application, there is a piece of 
code listening for mouse clicks on a URL. As the text which is displayed in the 
window is one of the HTML files that can be found in the help system, clicking 
on a URL launches a browser window. This single line of code is only intended to 
work with Windows platforms and may cause an error on other platforms. There are 
checks within the application to stop the code from executing.</p>
