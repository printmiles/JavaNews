<p>It is possible to edit some data contained within the JavaNews application. 
You can add comments to messages received through the message details window 
(more about how to do this can be found <a href="guicomdata.html">here</a>). 
Links can be edited, acknowledged and added through the link details window.</p>
<p>There is an application specifically designed to import multiple recognised 
codex records called JNFixer. More information about this can be found in the 
appendices, <a href="jnfixer.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The link details window can be used to perform various tasks. These depend on 
the type of link that was double-clicked on to show it. These are detailed 
below.</p>
<h3>Options for recognised links</h3>
<p>Clicking on the Add / Edit button will bring up a prompt giving you two 
options. To edit the link you have displayed or to add a new one.</p>
<h4>Editing the existing link</h4>
<p>You will be able to change the details and description of the link. The 
existing contents of each field will be displayed for you to amend or skip if 
need be.</p>
<h4>Adding a new link</h4>
<p>New entries can be added to the list of recognised links by providing the PSE 
name, the link ID and some details and a description. You will be able to enter 
each of these data items in turn into an input window.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>You should ensure that the details and description are 255 characters or less (including spaces)
otherwise they may be truncated.</p>
</div>
<h4>Options for discovered links</h4>
<p>Clicking on the Add / Edit button will instantly prompt you for details of 
the link you were viewing and a description. Like before, there is a limit to 
the number of characters you can enter into each of these fields.</p>
<p>Once you have entered these two fields you will notice that the link 
&quot;disappears&quot; from the discovered link table. What has happened is you have 
&quot;recognised&quot; the link. It will no longer appear in the discovered table but will 
appear (and has been moved to) the recognised links table. You will also notice 
that it has been added to the bottom of the report tree on the left-hand side of 
the screen. Once the application is restarted then you will notice that any 
nodes you have recognised will appear in their correct alphabetical order.</p>
