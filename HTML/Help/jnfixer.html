<p>It is possible to edit some data contained within the JavaNews application. 
You can add comments to messages received through the message details window 
(more about how to do this can be found <a href="guicomdata.html">here</a>). 
Links can be edited, acknowledged and added through the link details window.</p>
<p>JNFixer can be used to perform two functions. Import delimited (separated) 
data into the main database and check the structure of the database that it 
connects to.</p>
<h3>Starting JNFixer</h3>
<p>JNFixer is a small application designed to run through a command prompt (DOS 
window). You will find an icon included in the start menu folder created through 
the automated installation for Windows<sup> TM</sup> machines. Otherwise you will need to 
execute the program manually by opening a command line window and entering the 
following command: <code>java jnfixer.Main</code> this will launch the application.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>You will be asked to enter the name of the database for JNFixer to connect 
to. This should be the name of the Data Source Name (DSN) of the database as you 
have configured in the ODBC window.</p>
<p>JNFixer will then connect to the database and examine the structure of the 
tables and fields within each table. The database will be checked for compliance 
against the structure shown in the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram in the 
technical information that can be found <a href="erdiagram.html">here</a>.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>JNFixer will log into the database using the ID you specified in the ODBC configuration.</p>
</div>
<p>JNFixer will firstly look through the database for the tables named as shown in the ER diagram.
If they cannot be found then they are added. This means that the user ID which 
is used to connect to the database should have sufficient privileges to use the 
CREATE TABLE command in SQL. If JNFixer can find the tables it will examine 
their structure for the named fields of valid types for use with JavaNews. 
Missing or fields of the wrong data type will be listed in the output.</p>

</code></p>
<div class="warning"><p>JNFixer is not able to amend incorrect fields 
	(attributes) within a table. You must consult the ER diagram to find the 
	correct configuration needed for JavaNews and refer to your database 
	vendor&#39;s documentation to find out how to correct the problem.</p></div>
<p>As shown once JNFixer has checked the structure of the database it has 
connected to and created any missing tables you are presented with a choice of 
options. The second and third options show further information in the window and 
return you to this menu. The first option will allow you to import batches of 
records into the database. This is covered in the next section. The last option 
allows you to exit JNFixer.</p>
<div class="warning"><p>JNFixer does create indexes (primary keys) in each of 
	the tables it recreates. However it does not recreate foreign keys between 
	tables that are shown in the ER diagram. These are maintained by JavaNews 
	itself and not essential to the database structure.</p>
</div>
<h3>Importing records using JNFixer</h3>
<div class="warning"><p>You must ensure that all tables and fields are shown
to be correct before attempting to import any data into them.</p></div>
<p>You are able to import data into the JavaNews database from a text file. Data 
can be imported into either the recognised links table or the message tables. 
These are both additive functions so will only add the imported records to what 
data is already contained within them, and won&#39;t delete or amend existing data.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the table you wish to add data to you will be asked to 
enter the full path of the file to be imported. Please note the manner in which 
the path must be entered. You <strong>must</strong> use the correct format for 
both the file name and the file contents for the import to work successfully.</p>
<p><code>
Please enter the full path of the file to import.<br/>
The path should use either \\ or / to denote directories.<br/>
i.e. C:\\JavaNews\\ImportMe.txt or C:/JavaNews/ImportMe.txt<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Press ENTER when finished.<br/>
c:/jn install cd/jnfixer/Blank TXT Files/Severity 1 Messages.txt<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Importing. Please wait...<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Imported 157 records.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
</code></p>
<p>Once you have entered the file path, you can hit ENTER and the total number of records 
imported will be shown. You will then be taken back to the main menu of JNFixer.</p>
<h3>Ensuring data is in the right format</h3>
<p>Data can be imported into either the recognised links table (tblCodexLinks) or the 
message definition table (tblMessages). You should use a spreadsheet or database 
program to enter data into a file with these columns in the order shown below. 
Each column&#39;s entry should be separated from the next with a semicolon (;) and 
so in a raw text file the result should look like this:</p>
<p><code>Column 1 contents;Column 2 contents;Column 3 contents</code></p>
<p>Notice that spaces are allowed and that text doesn&#39;t require its own 
delimiter (&quot; is sometimes used to mark the start and end of a section of text).</p>
<div class="warning"><p>You might notice from the ER diagram that there is an ID field.<br/>
	JNFixer generates these automatically with 32 character universally 
	unique identifiers.</p></div>
