<p>Within the application you need to set a logging directory along with a logging level.
While the application runs it generates events. These can range in severity and normally don't need to be
seen. However, if there are problems while running the application then the log files are useful to finding
exactly what the problems is and where it lies. You should make the logging directory used by the application 
somewhere that is easy to locate and is always available (avoid using network 
drives if they might not be available).</p>
<h3>Organisation of the Files</h3>
<p>If you were to look into the log directory, the first reaction might be "there's an awful lot of files in there",
or, "it looks complicated, I'll leave it alone".</p>
<p>Each of the files contained within the directory represent a particular 
class within the application. A class can be thought of as a chunk of code 
responsible for a set of tasks within the application as a whole. The log 
files for JavaNews can be distinguished from other XML files from the fact 
that they end .log.xml.</p>
<p>All of the .log.xml are named after a fully qualified package and class 
name followed by a sequential number for conflicts. For JavaNews all of the 
packages are in the javanews package. 
This forms a common start for all of the file names. After this is the next 
sub-package name and the class name, separated by a full-stop (for example 
javanews.gui.Client is the Client class
within the gui package within the application). The sub-packages are organised
as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr class="tableheader">
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Purpose</td>
		<td>Qualified Name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>database</td>
		<td>Used to hold classes used to connect to or work with the back-end database through JDBC and/or SQL.</td>
		<td>.database</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>events</td>
		<td>Used to hold event classes used to perform actions within the application.</td>
		<td>.events</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>gui (Subclass of events)</td>
		<td>Used to hold GUI events triggered from the user working with the application.</td>
		<td>.events.gui</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>table (Subclass of events)</td>
		<td>Used to hold data events relating to tables and the data within them being changed.</td>
		<td>.events.table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>gui</td>
		<td>Used to hold the major GUI classes. Mainly the main application window and the splash screen shown during start-up.</td>
		<td>.gui</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>internalframe (Subclass of gui)</td>
		<td>Used to hold the classes of windows shown within the main application window. These include configuration, help and data windows.</td>
		<td>.gui.internalframe</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>object</td>
		<td>Used to hold objects commonly used by other classes within the application.</td>
		<td>.object</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>print (Subclass of object)</td>
		<td>Used to hold classes required specifically for printing.</td>
		<td>.object.print</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>table (Subclass of object)</td>
		<td>Used to hold classes used to hold and display data within tables so they can be displayed on-screen.</td>
		<td>.object.table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>run</td>
		<td>Used to hold classes needed to start the application.</td>
		<td>.run</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>For more information about the purposes of each class within the 
application, you can refer to the <a href="./javadoc/index.html">Javadoc</a>.</p>
<h3>Viewing the Files</h3>
<p>The log files are also used to record any messages received from the PSE network and can be found in some 
of the files within the log directory. If you use a file browser to explore the 
logging directory you will see many different files. They can be opened in any application that recognises XML 
content. Microsoft&#39;s Excel is good for compiling multiple XML files, while 
Apache Chainsaw is able to view log files as well.</p>
<p>The document type definition (DTD) for log files can be viewed on the Sun 
Microsystems website and it gives information about the contents of the XML 
file and the purpose for each of the fields.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Excel</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Excel allows for records to be imported and then sorted and filtered using tools familiar to most.</p>
		<p>Multiple files must be manually cut and paste into a single file to follow the program execution.</p></td>
		<td class="images">
		  <ul>
		    <li>
		      <a href="./resources/appendixlogs-ExcelShot.png"><img alt="Excel screenshot" height="243" longdesc="Excel shown viewing an XML log file from JavaNews" src="./resources/appendixlogs-ExcelShot.png" width="320" /></a>

            </li>
          </ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4>Apache Chainsaw</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Apache chainsaw allows for XML log files to be viewed and sorted similar to Excel. However, it does have problems accessing large files.</p></td>
		<td class="images">
		  <ul>
		    <li>
		      <a href="./resources/appendixlogs-ChainsawShot.png"><img alt="Apache Chainsaw screenshot" height="243" longdesc="Excel shown viewing an XML log file from JavaNews" src="./resources/appendixlogs-ChainsawShot.png" width="320" /></a>
		      Apache Chainsaw log file viewer. (Click to enlarge)
		    </li>
		  </ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4>Other Applications</h4>
<p>Other applications can be used to open XML files, notepad is one and all will display the content of these text
based files. For more information on the information contained within a log file, refer to the DTD at the Sun site.</p>
