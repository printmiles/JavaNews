<p>From the installation disc, all you need to do to install JavaNews is to copy the contents of the disc to a suitably named folder.</p>
<p>As the application is able to run on multiple operating systems it makes developing an installer difficult for all of the possible platforms.</p>
	<p>To install the application you need at least 50MB of hard-drive space 
	plus room for log files. The log files can be specified to be written to 
	another directory and can be located on a network resource if needed. The 
	size of log files will vary according to the amount and type of events 
	recorded.</p>
	<h3>Add-ons (Library files)</h3>
	<p>There are some add-ons that must be installed to ensure that the 
	application works correctly. These files must be copied to certain 
	directories. To learn more you should read the add-ons section on the
	<a href="javainstall.html">Installing Java</a> page.</p>
	<h3>Automated Install</h3>
	<p>There is an installer for JavaNews in the main directory of the installation CD.
	The file is named Setup.exe and will install all of the files needed as part of the
	application. You won't need to manually copy any of the files and it will also
	provide a means to uninstall the files at a later date if required.</p>
	<p>This automated installation is only available for Windows platforms and 
	not for any others at the moment. If you follow the steps through the 
	installation. When asked which sections to install, select all of the items 
	unless you specifically need to. This will install all of the files relating 
	to JavaNews and the libraries it needs in the relevant locations.</p>
<p>Once complete the installer will provide desktop and start menu shortcuts to 
the application components and allow you to uninstall the application as well.</p>
