<p>First off, don't panic! 
It could be something major, it could be something minor. Hopefully it&#39;s the 
latter but with a bit of luck the problem will go away and never darken our 
doorstep again. If the problem does occur again then try and make a mental note 
of what was happening, what were you doing if anything? Does the error always 
occur doing the same thing?</p>
	<p>If the error is predictable and repeatable then it can be investigated 
	and fixed. Just look through the following sections to get a better idea of 
	what to send so that the problem can be investigated and fixed.</p>
<p>One thing that will help when trying to identify the cause of the problem is 
to ensure that the logs are running at the most detailed level (this is finest 
or all, both will set them to the same level). This will allow for the logs to 
record what has happened when the error occurs. Once you have captured the 
error, make sure that you return the logging level to the previous level and 
restart the application.</p>
