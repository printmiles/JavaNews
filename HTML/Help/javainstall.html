<div class="content">
<p>JavaNews has been designed and built in the Java language. It makes use of features implemented in Java Standard Edition 
(SE) v1.6.0 and higher. A copy of Java has been included for ease in the program 
directory, this is the 1.6.0 update 11 release. Newer releases can be found at
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Java.com</a>.</p>
<p>The installation of the Java SE runtime edition is straight-forward and you should just follow the on-screen instructions and accept
the default settings where needed (you may want to change default installation path). Once complete it is recommended to restart the PC
to ensure that the system has been updated correctly.</p>
	<h3>Add-on libraries</h3>
	<p>In order for JavaNews to function correctly you must install two add-ons 
	to the standard Java libraries. These add-ons are RxTx and JFreeChart which 
	have been written by 3rd parties. More information about both of these 
	add-ons can be found both in the Bibliography and Licensing information 
	pages that can be found in the menu on the right.</p>
	<div class="warning"><p>If you use the automated installation you will not need to manually install these files.</p></div>
	<p>During the installation of Java you should noted which installation 
	directory is used for the new version (for Windows platforms this should be along the lines of <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jrexxxx</code>,
	where xxxx is the version being installed).</p>
	<p>Within the Java installation directory you should find the <code>\lib\ext</code> folder and 
	the <code>\bin</code> folder. These are the two directories used to install add-on libraries. 
	You can find the files that require copying into these locations in the 
	<code>Libraries</code> folder on the JavaNews installation CD. The library 
	files section below lists the files, their purpose and which folder they 
	should be copied to.</p>
	<h3>Installing newer versions of Java</h3>
	<p>If you need to update your installed version of Java to a newer version, 
	you must ensure that all of the add-on files are copied to their respective 
	folders to ensure that JavaNews works with the new version of Java.</p>
	<div class="warning"><p>Installing a new version of Java will not automatically move add-on libraries to the new version.</p></div>
	<h4>Library files</h4>
	<p>These are the files required for the add-ons. The column &quot;Must Be Located 
	In&quot; shows which folder within your Java installation the folder the file 
	should be placed in. So, if your version of Java is located in <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_11\</code>
	then the file <code>rxtxSerial.dll</code> should be placed in the folder <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_11\bin\</code>:</p>

<h3>If you are using a prior version of Java</h3>
<p>You can install a new version of Java into a different folder from the earlier installation. If problems arise during execution then you should uninstall
both versions and reinstall the newer, however this is unlikely.</p>
<h3>If you are using Microsoft JVM or a Virtual Machine from another manufacturer</h3>
<p>You must install the Sun Java SE Runtime. The Virtual Machine used by Sun contains the whole Java specification and other manufacturers can prove incompatible with native code.</p>
