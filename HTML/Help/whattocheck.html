<h3>The Database</h3>
<p>Ensure that the database is correctly configured and has capacity for adding new records. It may be the case where the database needs to be altered to 
allow more records to be stored. You might also find that the database would 
benefit from being compacted which can increase performance and reduce the size 
of the overall database.</p>
<h3>The COM Ports</h3>
<p>If you have configured JavaNews to work with a particular COM port then it will try to access this port every-time the application starts. Make sure that it is available in the Device Manager (or equivalent) before starting the application. 
If you cannot get the COM port to work then ensure that you access the COM port 
configuration and hit the Save button, even if you have not set any other COM 
port to be monitored. This erases the configuration from the preferences file 
and allows you to use the application on its own.</p>
<h3>Network Drives</h3>
<p>If you have specified that JavaNews should use a network drive or resource for the database or for log files then you must make sure that the network resource is available. If it is not then this will cause a problem as JavaNews expects to be able to access these resources and cannot work without them. If it is possible then try to use a location on the local machine for items like logging.</p>
